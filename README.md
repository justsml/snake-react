# Dan's Snake Refactor 

## Exploring State Management Designs

Many factors could influence the design...

1. Store a rewindable/replayable stack of EVERY cell change or move (redux-ish)
    1. Could simplify logic around 1UPs, enemies (certain cases)
1. Save only list of key presses with each's coords: might save overall memory, speed. 
    1. Better for a websockets multi-player variant
